# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was motivated by the need to create an easy and useful website for bootcamp students to begin to understand code.

Through this project I learnt how to create folders through gitbash, how to code a website and how to save the information on GitHub for other people to contribute to.

I came across several bugs which made me got back and check through my work to see where i went wrong and helped me become a better coder.
